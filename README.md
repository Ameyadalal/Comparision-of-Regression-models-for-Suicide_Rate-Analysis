# Comparision-of-Regression-models-for-Suicide_Rate-Analysis
This project aims to train a model using machine learning techniques to help predict probability of suicide_rate using data collected from various elements with comparison of models.

The data collected from the kaggle contains missing values as well as categorical data that needs to be converted to numeric values. This data is divided into training and test sets, so that trained model can be evaluated on unseen data. After processing the data, it is used to train various regressions models and it is evaluated using test data. The performance of the model is compared and the comparison result is used to find best model suited for predicting the suicide rate.

All the steps and their results are documented in the report file, and the output at each step can be seen in Python notebook.
